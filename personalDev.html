  <div class="book-content">
    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h3>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Achievement isn't an accident — it's built with specific goals and focused effort. Jim shows that people often work harder for company goals than personal ones, and one should not rush the process of defining personal dreams. The process involves setting clear, measurable goals and creating an action plan to reach them.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> I learned that setting goals gives direction and encouragement. I can do this by setting school and personal targets — like completing assignments early or saving a certain amount each month. Writing them down helps me stay on track.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 5 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h3>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Jim emphasizes respecting and using time wisely. Everyone gets 24 hours, but successful people make the best use of theirs by focusing on activities that lead to long-term success. He warns against wasting time on unproductive habits and distractions.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> This chapter reminded me that lost time can never be recovered. I’ll create a daily study, rest, and exercise routine and spend less time on social media. Managing time well will boost productivity and reduce stress.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 6 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The authors stress that we become like the people we spend time with. Surround yourself with positive, goal-oriented people who push you to improve.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> I realized how my environment affects my thinking. I will spend time with friends who encourage personal and academic growth. Study groups and positive mentors will help me stay motivated.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 7 -->
    <div class="chapter">
      <h3>Chapter 7: Be a Lifelong Learner</h3>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Continuous learning is the key to success. School gives the basics, but self-education — reading, seminars, and experiences — keeps the mind strong and adaptable.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> I plan to read one self-help book per month and learn new skills like communication or leadership. Lifelong learning keeps me ready for challenges and growth.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Overall Reflection -->
    <div class="chapter overall">
      <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
      <p>These chapters focus on purposeful living — goal setting, time management, choosing good friends, and lifelong learning. Following these lessons will make me more disciplined, focused, and strong in all areas of life.</p>
