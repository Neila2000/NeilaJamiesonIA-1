<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
<p>To lead a purposeful life that is fueled by love, bolstered by health, and enabled by prosperity.</p>
<p><i>“Where there is love, there is life.” — Mahatma Gandhi</i> </p>

<h2> Mission Statment </h2>
<p>My goal is to live a meaningful life that is based on love, steered by compassion, and fortified by prosperity and good health. I work hard to build deep relationships, make a difference in other people's lives, and seek development in all spheres of life spiritual, physical, and emotional. Motivated by Mahatma Gandhi's statement, "Life exists where love exists," I want to make love the cornerstone of everything I do and the impetus for my quest for impact and fulfillment.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>My top three strongest personality trait:</p>
     <ol> 
        <li>Being <bold>responsible </bold> allows me to be able to orgainize and stay ontop of my school work. I take my duties very serious and always try my best in each course.</li>
        <li>My <bold> creativity</bold> side pushes me to try and learn new things. It doesn't only me thing of orginal and creative ideas for projects but also help me in solving problems.</li>
        <li> Being <bold>adventurous</bold> pushes me to try new things which I believe helps me to stay open to new expernices that I can learn to apply in school and my life.</li>    
    </ol> 
    <p>My hobbies include reading, exploring new places, foods and culture, listening music from all
       around the world and being and avid learner. I belive these hobbies have taught me various things on 
       various topics, allowing me to be knowledgeable about alot of thing in academics and life</p>
    <h2>My Mentor and Hero</h2>
    <p>My mentor and hero is <bold>God</bold>, God has always been there for me in every step in my life, even when I'm not leaning on him for support he supports me. Every prayer I make and it should be fullfilled he answers, he guides and protect me from big and small.
       Most importantly, he teaches me stay patient, strong and faithful even when things are tough. His love and guidance inspires me to be good and treat others with kidness </p>
    <p>My favourite quote or I must say verse is <i>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. - Proverbs 3:5</i>.This verse reminds me that with God's help, I can overcome anything and stay confident in all I do.</p>

     <h2>AI Buisnesses of 2025- AI Powered Content Creation</h2>
      <p>My favourite idea from the  
    <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/ai-business-ideas/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gs_cpc_arlv_nnc_nb_trial_all-devices_troas_lp_x_all-departments_x_taskmanagement&utm_content=all-countries_kw-target_text_all-industries_all-features_all-use-cases_ai_phrase&utm_term=&utm_creative=713306049272_dynamic_rsa&utm_custom1=&utm_custom2=&utm_lptheme=&utm_lpmod=&utm_mt=b&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20991268246&gbraid=0AAAAACR5vILU0g-x04iCx87mMamUTeoIH&gclid=CjwKCAjwz5nGBhBBEiwA-W6XRIQZsF7yLDP16BfpWsbYikH4E69bDednyP7xS9c0EhczOSDfi7TX_xoCmeYQAvD_BwE"target="_blank">AI Businesses of 2025</a> blog is AI powered content creation. This idea uses artificial intelligence to help people write blogs, social media posts, videos, and designs quickly and creatively. It can be applied in my universe by helping students create posters, essays, and online projects more conveniently, and helping small businesses with online advertising without having to pay expensive designers. It is helpful as it saves time, stimulates creativity, and enhances the quality of work. There are some ethical issues like plagiarism, misinformation, and over dependence on AI. These can be addressed by checking all AI created materials, providing proper credits, and applying AI as an assistant not a substitute for human thought. An actual example is <a href="https://www.canva.com/magic/?msockid=15360b4d9994682d22b81f24981b6915""target="_blank">Canva Magic Studio</a>
, which utilizes AI to generate and compose texts. Overall, AI-based content generation can make learning and communication possible if utilized in an ethical manner.</p>
